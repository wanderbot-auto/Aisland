# CLAUDE.md

## What is this project?

Aisland is a native macOS companion app for AI coding agents. It sits in the notch/top-bar area and monitors local agent sessions, surfaces permission requests, answers questions, and provides "jump back" to the correct terminal context. Local-first, no server dependency.

## Architecture

Four targets in one Swift package (`Aisland`):

1. **AislandApp** — SwiftUI + AppKit shell. Menu bar extra, overlay panel (notch/top-bar), and control center window. Entry point: `AislandApp.swift` with `AppModel` as the central `@Observable` state owner.
2. **AislandCore** — Shared library. Models (`AgentSession`, `AgentEvent`, `SessionState`), bridge transport (Unix socket IPC with JSON line protocol), hook models/installers for both Codex and Claude Code, transcript discovery, session persistence/registry.
3. **AislandHooks** — Lightweight CLI executable invoked by agent hooks. Reads hook payload from stdin, forwards to app bridge via Unix socket, writes blocking JSON to stdout only when island denies a `PreToolUse`.
4. **AislandSetup** — Installer CLI for managing `~/.codex/config.toml` and `hooks.json`.

## Key data flow

### Codex path
Codex → hooks.json → AislandHooks (stdin/stdout) → Unix socket → BridgeServer → AppModel → UI

### Claude Code path
Claude Code → settings.json hooks → AislandHooks (stdin/stdout) → Unix socket → BridgeServer.handleClaudeHook → AppModel → UI

### Session discovery (on launch)
Restore cached sessions from registry → discover recent JSONL transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/`) → reconcile with active terminal processes → start live bridge.

## Supported scope (narrow by design)

- **Agents**: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, General Agent
- **Terminals**: Terminal.app, Ghostty, iTerm2, WezTerm, cmux, Kaku, Zellij; tmux (multiplexer)
- **IDE workspace jump**: VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, JetBrains IDEs
- Do NOT expand scope unless explicitly asked

## Build & test

```bash
swift build
swift test
swift run AislandApp                            # run the app
swift build -c release --product AislandHooks   # build hook binary
```

Open `Package.swift` in Xcode for the app target. Requires macOS 14+, Swift 6.2.

## Required Workflow

> **⚠️ NEVER edit files directly in the main worktree.** Use `EnterWorktree` or `git worktree` to work in an isolated copy.

1. Start each round by checking the current repository state with `git status -sb`.
2. **Enter a worktree** before making any edits — use `EnterWorktree` (preferred) or `git worktree add` to create an isolated working copy based on `main`.
3. Read the relevant files before editing. Do not guess repository structure or behavior.
4. Keep each round focused on a single coherent change.
5. After making changes, run the most relevant verification available for that round.
6. Summarize what changed, including any verification gaps.
7. Commit, push to remote, exit the worktree (`ExitWorktree`), and create a PR to merge into `main`.

## Commit Policy

- Every round that modifies files must end with a commit.
- Do not batch unrelated changes into one commit.
- Use conventional-style commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
- Do not amend existing commits unless explicitly requested.
- Create a feature branch (e.g. `fix/<topic>`, `feat/<topic>`) for every independent change. Do not commit directly to `main`.

## Safety Rules

- Never revert or overwrite user changes unless explicitly requested.
- If unexpected changes appear, inspect them and work around them when possible.
- If a conflict makes the task ambiguous or risky, stop and ask before proceeding.
- Never use destructive Git commands such as `git reset --hard` without explicit approval.

## Branching Rules

- `main` is a protected branch (GitHub branch protection enabled). **NEVER commit or push directly to `main`.**
- All changes MUST go through a Pull Request to merge into `main`. Direct pushes are rejected.
- All feature branches must be created from the latest local `main`.
- Each agent or workstream should work on its own branch, named to match the topic (e.g. `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`).
- Standard flow: **EnterWorktree → develop → commit → push → ExitWorktree → create PR → merge**.
- For parallel Agent sub-tasks, use `Agent(isolation: "worktree")` to give each agent its own isolated copy.
- **All PRs MUST target `main` as base branch.** Never target another feature branch. Chain PRs (A → B → main) are prohibited — they cause silent change loss when merge order is wrong. If work depends on an unmerged branch, wait for it to merge to main first, then rebase.

## Release Policy

- **Bilingual required**: Every release MUST include both English and Chinese (Simplified) descriptions. Use the template in `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Before creating a release, fetch remote `main` and review ALL merged PRs since the last tag to avoid missing changes.
- Each changelog entry follows the format: `- **Category**: English description (#PR)\n  中文描述 (#PR)`. For external contributors, append `— Thanks @username` to the English line.
- The release title follows: `Aisland vX.Y.Z — Short English Title`
- The Installation section must be bilingual.
- Release is triggered by pushing a `v*` tag to `main`. The GitHub Actions workflow builds, signs, notarizes, and publishes the DMG automatically.

## App Targets And Naming

- `AislandApp` (via `swift run AislandApp` or the Xcode target) is the canonical development runtime.
- `~/Applications/Aisland Dev.app` is a local bundle wrapper around the repo-built binary, not a separate product.
- When launching `Aisland Dev.app`, refresh the bundle first with `zsh scripts/launch-dev-app.sh` instead of only `open -na` (avoids stale binaries).
- **One-time setup**: run `zsh scripts/setup-dev-signing.sh` once to create a local self-signed code signing identity. Without it the dev bundle is ad-hoc signed, which changes cdhash every rebuild and silently invalidates any macOS TCC grant (Accessibility, Automation) you gave the previous build. Required when iterating on features that touch AX API (precision jump, keystroke/menu injection, etc.).
- Use `scripts/harness.sh smoke` or `scripts/smoke-dev-app.sh` only for deterministic harness runs.
- `/Applications/Vibe Island.app` and `https://vibeisland.app/` are closed-source reference baselines only — behavior benchmarks, not the development runtime.

## Reference Baselines

- Official product reference: `https://vibeisland.app/`
- On Macs with a built-in notch, the island sits in the notch area; on external displays or non-notch Macs, it falls back to a compact top-center bar.
- Community reference: `https://github.com/farouqaldori/claude-island` — useful for design patterns, not a product spec.
- Do NOT import from `claude-island` unless explicitly asked: analytics (Mixpanel etc.), window-manager scope (`yabai`), Claude-only assumptions that weaken the shared agent model, raising the support boundary beyond the surfaces already listed.

## Conventions

- Prefer small end-to-end slices over speculative scaffolding
- Native macOS APIs over cross-platform abstractions
- Hooks fail open — if app/bridge unavailable, agents keep running unchanged
- The `SessionState.apply(_:)` reducer is the single source of truth for session mutations
- Bridge protocol uses newline-delimited JSON envelopes (`BridgeCodec`)
- All models are `Sendable` and `Codable`

## Verification

- Run targeted checks that match the change (`swift build`, `swift test`, or manual verification).
- If no automated verification exists yet, state that explicitly in the summary and still commit.
